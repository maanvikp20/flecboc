            <h2>About Wrexham A.F.C.</h2>
            <p><strong>Wrexham Association Football Club</strong> (Welsh: <em>Clwb Pêl-droed Wrecsam</em>) is a professional football club based in Wrexham, Wales. Established in 1864, it is the oldest football club in Wales and the third-oldest professional football team in the world. The team currently competes in <strong>EFL League One</strong>, the third tier of the English football league system.</p>
            
            <h3>Early History and League Competitions</h3>
            <p>Initially participating in friendly matches and cup competitions, Wrexham entered its first league in 1890, joining <em>The Combination</em>. Over 13 seasons, they secured four Combination titles before moving on to the Welsh Senior League and then the Birmingham & District League. By 1921, Wrexham became one of the founding members of the Football League's <strong>Third Division North</strong>.</p>
            <p>After several promotions and relegations across divisions, Wrexham reached their peak in 1977-78 by winning the Third Division and securing a place in the <strong>Second Division</strong>. Despite this success, the club faced financial difficulties and multiple relegations, ultimately dropping to the <strong>Fourth Division</strong> and enduring a long period of instability.</p>
            
            <h3>Rise and Fall: Financial Troubles and Administration</h3>
            <p>The club’s fortunes worsened in the early 2000s due to severe financial issues, including entering administration in 2004. Wrexham was relegated from the Football League in 2008, spending the next 15 years in the fifth tier (<strong>National League</strong>), with several unsuccessful promotion bids. However, in 2022-23, Wrexham was finally promoted as National League champions, followed by a remarkable second consecutive promotion to <strong>EFL League One</strong> in April 2024.</p>
            
            <h3>Notable Achievements</h3>
            <p>Wrexham has a proud history of silverware. They’ve won the <strong>Welsh Cup</strong> a record 23 times and famously lifted the <strong>Football League Trophy</strong> in 2005 at the Millennium Stadium. The club also won the <strong>FA Trophy</strong> at Wembley in 2013 and claimed the <strong>FAW Premier Cup</strong> five times.</p>
            <p>On the international stage, Wrexham made their mark by defeating reigning English champions <strong>Arsenal</strong> in the 1992 FA Cup and stunning <strong>FC Porto</strong> 1-0 in the 1984 European Cup Winners' Cup. Wrexham qualified for European competitions through their Welsh Cup victories, participating in thrilling ties against European giants like <strong>FC Zürich</strong> and <strong>Petrolul Ploiești</strong> during the 1970s and 1990s.</p>
            
            <h3>Iconic Racecourse Ground</h3>
            <p>Wrexham’s home ground, the <strong>Racecourse Ground</strong>, holds a special place in football history as the oldest international stadium still in use. It hosted a record crowd of 34,445 during a 1957 match against Manchester United, and continues to serve as the club’s home and a venue for international games.</p>
            
            <h3>New Ownership and Global Fame</h3>
            <p>The 2020 purchase of the club by Canadian actor <strong>Ryan Reynolds</strong> and American actor <strong>Rob McElhenney</strong> transformed Wrexham A.F.C. into a global sensation. The <em>Welcome to Wrexham</em> docuseries, chronicling the club’s journey, brought unprecedented international attention, leading to a new wave of fans from around the world. Under this new era of ownership, Wrexham has not only climbed the football league ladder but also become a symbol of modern football’s growing global appeal.</p>
            
            <h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
            <p>With renewed hope and global interest, Wrexham A.F.C. aims to continue its upward journey through the football league system, while preserving its rich heritage. The team is setting its sights on further promotion, eyeing a return to its historic heights in English football.</p>
